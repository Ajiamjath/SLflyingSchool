      <h3>Srilanka Flying School Training Courses &amp; Services</h3>
      <p>Aviation / flight programs at Ontario colleges offer courses in navigation, flight preparation, air law and much more. On top of these theory courses, many hours will be spent training in flight simulators and actual planes, learning to maintain control and make decisions in a variety of flight situations. At the end of these programs, successful students are eligible to take the Integrated Commercial Pilot Licence exam to receive their pilotâ€™s licence.</p>
      <p>In addition to flight theory and training, early-semester fundamental math and physics courses help students strengthen their problem-solving and critical-thinking skills and prepare for more difficult technical courses and training.</p>

          <h5> General Aviation job and Salaries</h5>
          <p>Aviation flight programs provide students with the extensive flight hours needed to obtain a Commercial Pilot Licence. Having a licence opens the door to many opportunities - graduates have become pilots for charter, commuter, regional, national and international companies and airlines. New pilots from world  aviation programs typically work their way up to major airlines by gaining flight experience in general aviation and regional air carriers.

            Aside from becoming a pilot, programs can lead to specific aviation jobs in flight instruction, the military, operations, marketing and more.
            
            Salaries in the field vary depending on position, experience and certifications. Entry-level pilots can expect to make between $27,000 and $32,000 a year, with the potential to make much more when qualified for piloting larger or specialized aircraft.</p>
